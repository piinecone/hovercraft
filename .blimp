# Welcome to Blimp!

# - Use `blimp watch *.big_file_extension` to tell blimp about big files
# - Blimp will add the pattern to this file, like this:
#   *.big_file_extension
# - Blimp will also add that same pattern to your .gitignore.
# - Files matching the patterns in .blimp will be stored in the s3 bucket specified by your .git/config

# For example:
# *.big_file_extension
# *.some_other_big_file_extension
